# TypeScript Type Declarations

This directory contains custom TypeScript type declarations for third-party packages that don't have their own type definitions.

## Files

- `heic-convert.d.ts` - Type definitions for the heic-convert package used for converting iPhone HEIC images to JPEG format.

These declarations are automatically picked up by TypeScript during compilation.
